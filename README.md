Welcome to the Pong Game project! This simple yet classic Pong game is implemented in Java using Swing for GUI. It features two paddles, a ball, and keeps score for each player. The game runs in a JFrame and offers a basic but entertaining gaming experience.

Gameplay
The game starts with the ball in the center, moving in a random direction.
Players use their respective paddles to hit the ball.
If the ball hits the top or bottom edges of the window, it bounces back.
Scoring occurs when the ball passes either player's paddle.
The game continues indefinitely, keeping track of each player's score.
